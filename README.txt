A lightweight plugin that hides all Notices, Update Nags & Messages in your WordPress Admin allowing you to focus on what's important - your content.

== Description ==

Have you become tired of the clutter of Admin Notices that appear at the top of every page in your WordPress Admin?

With each new plugin or theme that you install, there seem to be more and more notices that appear at the top of each page!

With this simple plugin, you can claim back all this wasted screen space so that you can focus on what is important - creating your content.

Hide Admin Notices hides away all notices, update nags and messages and makes it easy for you to see them again, when you want.

#### HOW DOES IT WORK?

After activating this plugin, you will have a new **Show Notices** button at the top right-hand corner of your admin pages (just next to **Screen Options**).

Click the button to see all admin notices and just click the button again to hide them.
